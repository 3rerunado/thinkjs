One of the most appealing features of Red Alert 2 is its online multiplayer mode, which allows players to compete against each other or cooperate in teams on various maps and game modes. However, to play online, players need to install the Westwood Online Support Library, which is a set of files that enable the game to connect to the Westwood Online server and other players.
 
The Westwood Online Support Library is not included in the original game installation, and it may be missing or invalid if you have installed the game from a different source or updated it with unofficial patches. In this article, we will show you how to download and install the Westwood Online Support Library for Red Alert 2, so you can enjoy the online gameplay without any problems.
